# Mini Paint in Java
Mini Paint application developed in Java using Java Swing libraries for a lab assignment for an Object Oriented Programming course at Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

## Description
Our project focuses on the implementation of an object-oriented model for geometric shapes, including Line Segment, Circle, and Rectangle. Leveraging the power of inheritance and polymorphism, we have created a flexible and extensible system that allows for easy manipulation of these shapes. 

To provide a user-friendly interface, we have designed a GUI using the Swing graphics library. This GUI enables users to interact with the system through buttons and dialog boxes, providing a seamless experience for drawing and modifying shapes. Users can specify shape properties, such as length, radius, and coordinates, and observe real-time updates on the screen.

Our project encapsulates the core principles of object-oriented programming, allowing for modular and scalable development. By combining the power of inheritance, polymorphism, and a visually appealing GUI, we have created a comprehensive tool for working with geometric shapes, catering to the needs of both developers and end-users alike.
